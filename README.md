Acer Reseller (software quality and process management)

In this project, I developed an Acer reseller that allowed users to register and purchases either a laptop or a computer. Depending on the choice, the user is given a selection of different types of a computer model to choose from. Once a model has been selected, the user can then pick whichever device they would like and can view the chosen device. The preferred device can be modified to the user liking with the price atomically updating in real time. This was made using React JS, Node JS and using an MYSQL database. The purpose of this project was to learn about domain driven design, architecture, automated testing and the overall process of software development.
